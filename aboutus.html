    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>we are a group advocating for gender equality. our goal is to change peoples mind's about this topic and encourage others to do the same.
        We teach about both gender equality and inequality the best we can in order to convince as much people. By the end, we hope to have made at least a small impact.
    </p>
    <p>We started when a girl first opened up to us about how her ex-boyfriend treated her poorly. It was very sad and we empathized with her and helped her best we can. Over time a few others came to us about their story too.
        It opened our eyes and seeing how many people actually struggle with this, we took it upon ourselves to help. This is how we started our advocacy group, in hopes that we can help even more.</p>

    <p>I am Philiza Iah V. bacurnay. I'm a student looking to help others. though I cannot do much, I promise to help as much as possible.
        I am very passionate about this advocacy because though I, myself, have only few bad experiences about my gender I know a lot that do, whether in real life or online.
        I may never know what they are going through, but I made this to make sure that they, and everyone else, never will.
