  <!-- Background of the Problem -->
  <section>
    <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>
    <p>Gender inequality is a serious issue that needs to be fixed. 
    It is when a specific gender is degraded, discriminated, and harmed whether physically or mentally.
    Though it was worse back then, it doesn't mean that it is no longer important to talk about. Something that that everyone needs to follow is gender equality.
    </p>
    <p>Statistics show that the global gender gap as of 2025 is at 68.8%. though it may seem like a lot, it is only a 0.03% gap from 2024, which isn't a lot.
        As for the Philipphines it is at 77.9% from 2024 and 78.1% as of 2025. Though it is bigger than the global gender gap, a 0.2% improvement isn't very big.</p>

  <!-- What is being done -->
  <section>
    <h2>What is Being Done</h2>
    <p>Though the issue is ongoing, many efforts have been made to help fix this. From the Philippine government there is Magna Carta of Women & GEWE Plan which is a women's human rights law. 
     there is also Gender-Responsive Budgeting & Equanomics which ensures equal distribution of resources by giving equal opportunities. Aside from that there is Poverty Reduction and Social Protection
     and Inclusive Governance and Peacebuilding which which would allow a diverse group of people to be included in of decision-making of Governance processes.</p>
   <p> There are also non-government efforts from the Philippines. An example is the Civil Society & NGO Initiatives that guards the human rights of individuals. 
    Another is the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) Initiatives that focuses of enhancing gender equality and empowering women.
     There are other too, like Grassroots and Sectoral Organizations and Health and Rights-Focused NGOs.</p>

  <!-- Advocacy Involvement -->
  <section>
    <h2>Where I Come In</h2>
    <p>This is where I come in.I plan to teach about gender equality, in hopes that it resonates with everyone. I made this to promote gender equality and ecourage others to do the same.
        As of now I can only talk and try to spread gender equality as best as I can. Though it may not seem like much, if this message inspires at least 1 person to do the same, it might snow ball into 1 big equal community.  </p>
